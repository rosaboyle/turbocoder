# Rapid Release Process for TorchGrid

We are adopting a Rapid Release Process for the development of [Your Project Name]. Our aim is to release new features, updates, or fixes every Friday. This approach will allow for quicker feedback loops and more organized development efforts.

## Release Cycle

- Our release cycle is **6 days long**, with the new features being released every **Friday**.

## Guidelines for Feature Inclusion

1. **All-In or All-Out**: Any feature that is planned for inclusion in the Friday release should be broken down into smaller, manageable chunks. These smaller parts should either be:
    - Completed and included in the Friday release
    - Or left out entirely if they are not achievable within the 6-day cycle
    This approach prevents us from accumulating stale issues and ensures that our focus remains on quick, achievable results.

2. **Exceptional Cases**: If there is a specific reason to include a partially completed feature, it must be discussed and agreed upon by the team before the Friday release.

## Key Characteristics of Rapid Release Process

1. **Frequent Releases**: New content is released every Friday.
2. **Small, Incremental Changes**: Features are broken down into smaller chunks that can be quickly developed, tested, and deployed.

## General Principles

1. **Planning and Prioritization**: At the beginning of each cycle, the development team, along with product managers and stakeholders, will plan and prioritize the features or changes to be included in the upcoming release.
2. **Development**: Features are developed according to the plan.
3. **Code Review and Integration**: The code goes through a review process and is integrated into the existing codebase.
4. **Testing**: Automated tests are run to ensure the new features do not break existing functionality.
5. **Staging and Deployment**: The features are deployed to a staging environment for further tests, followed by deployment to production every Friday.
6. **Monitoring and Feedback**: After deployment, the changes are closely monitored and any issues that arise are quickly fixed.
7. **Review and Retrospective**: A review takes place after each release to discuss what went well and what could be improved for future releases.

By following these guidelines, we aim to foster a more organized, efficient, and effective development process.
